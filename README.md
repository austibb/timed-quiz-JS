# timed-quiz-JS

## Goal
The goal of this assignment was to create a dynamic, interactive webpage from scratch that would allow the user to play a timed and scored quiz game. Upon completion, the user will be able to save their score to a leaderboard stored local to their device. When the game begins, the page changes to begin displaying questions, with a timer counting down from 60 seconds. Each incorrect answer decrements an additional 10 seconds from the clock. When the quiz is terminated (either by completing the questions, running out the clock, or by clicking the 'view high scores' button, the game ends and the current time left is recorded as the score. This website utilizes a barebones .html page, populated dynamically with javascript and jQuery. CSS is used to create a consistent, user friendly interface.
